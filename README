# Introduction

This repo is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of [Andrej Karpathy's Char-LSTM](https://pytorch.org/).

# How to use

I haven't included the training data in the repo as the Tiny-Shakespeare dataset doesn't belong to me and I don't want to get in trouble for distributing the entire works of Shakespeare on Github, but the version Karpathy used can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt)

You don't have to use the Shakespeare data, it will work with any text file, just make sure to update the path to the file in `main.py`.

Once you've got this you can train a model by simply running `./main.py`
